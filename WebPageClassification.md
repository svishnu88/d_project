## Web Page Classification

### Problem Statement

Classification of Web page content is vital to many tasks in Web information retrieval such as maintaining Web directories and focused crawling. The uncontrolled nature of Web content presents additional challenges to Web page classification as compared to traditional text classification, however the interconnected nature of hypertext also provides features that can assist the process.

1. People profile
2. Conferences/Congress
3. Forums
4. News article
5. Clinical trials
6. Publication
7. Thesis
8. Guidelines
9. Others
